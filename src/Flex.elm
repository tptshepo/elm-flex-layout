{-| This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.
-}
type Direction
    = Row
    | Column


{-| `row`: This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.
-}
row : Direction
row =
    Row


{-| `column`: same as row but top to bottom
-}
column : Direction
column =
    Column


{-| This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.
-}
type Alignment
    = Start
    | Center
    | End
    | SpaceBetween
    | SpaceAround
    | SpaceEvenly
    | Stretch


{-| `flex-start` items are placed at the start of the cross axis. The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the flex-direction rules.
-}
start : Alignment
start =
    Start


{-| `center` items are centered in the cross-axis.
-}
center : Alignment
center =
    Center


{-| `flex-end` items are placed at the end of the cross axis. The difference again is subtle and is about respecting flex-direction rules.
-}
end : Alignment
end =
    End


{-| `space-between` items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line.
-}
spaceBetween : Alignment
spaceBetween =
    SpaceBetween


{-| `space-around` items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces arenâ€™t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.
-}
spaceAround : Alignment
spaceAround =
    SpaceAround


{-| `space-evenly` items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.
-}
spaceEvenly : Alignment
spaceEvenly =
    SpaceEvenly


{-| `stretch` to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)
-}
stretch : Alignment
stretch =
    Stretch


{-| Returns an array of `Html.Attributes.style` required to align the child items
